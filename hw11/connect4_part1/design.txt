1. What data structures you’ll need (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
    lists (lists of lists)
    dictionaries (to select winners)

2. What classes you’ll define
    Chess (to draw chess)
    Board (to draw board)
    GameController (main controller of the program)

3. What functions you’ll need (methods within classes, or other functions that exist outside of any class)
    Chess:
        draw_me (to draw chess)
    Board:
        draw_me (to draw board)
    GameController:
        initialize (to create list of list to store every Chess class created)
        update (main drawing function exist in draw() in processing)
        hold_and_drop (behaviors when player holds and drops the chess)
        chess_color (return the correct color when player switches)
        change_player (change player in turns)
        check_release_spot (check the correct place in column to put chess)
        check_game_end (return True if the board is full)
        check_column_full (return True if a column is full)
        check_mouse_area (return True if the mouse is put in right when human player is pressing the mouse)
        game_over (print certain text if the game is over or a player wins)
        check_winner (return True if a player's chesses can form a "connect 4" based on his/her chesses' positions in the list of list)
        get_winner (return a player name if he/she wins)
        ai_behavior (certain rules/algorithms for ai player to drop chess)
        get_user_name (get the name of human_player)
        output_result (put player name and his/her winning times into a file)

4. A bullet-pointed pseudocode of your driver: Tell us about the flow of control, and think about the following cases:
    When the user makes a move
        When the game start and after computer's turn
        The mouse will be contrained right above the board

    When the disk is dropping
        After mouse is released and if it is legal to put the disk in a certain column

    When it’s the computer’s turn
        Right after the player's turn and certain delay

    When game over status is assessed
        1. A winner shows up (either human player or ai player)
        2. No legal move can be made (the board is full)
