<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p><b>• In very brief and general terms, what is an algorithm?</b></p>
<p>"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed."
</p>
<p>An algorithm is a finite sequence of steps, each step taking a finite length of time, that solves a problem
    or computes a result.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• In very brief and general terms, how does Hilbert’s Decision Problem (Entscheidungsproblem) relate to
        limitations of computers?</b></p>
<p>Given a set of axioms and logical rules, is there a step-by-step process we can follow to decide whether an arbitrary
    statement is provable from the axioms?</p>
<p><b>it is not computable</b> </p>
<br>
<p><b>• What are some factors that go into determining whether an algorithm is “good” or “bad”?</b></p>
<p><b>decidability</b>: is the problem solvable algorithmically?</p>
<p><b>complexity</b>: how much time or space is required to solve the problem?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Variables and types
</h2>
<p><b>• What is the first thing that needs to happen to any variable in a Python script?</b></p>
<p>Python variables come into existence when they are assigned a value.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is the assignment operator and what does it do?</b></p>
<p>"=", Variables are assigned values with the = operator. </p>
<br>
<p><b>• Python is dynamically typed. What does this mean in terms of variables and their values?
    </b></p>
<p>A variable is the type of whatever value is currently assigned to it. A value of a different type can be freely
    assigned to it later.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What are the syntactic rules for naming variables? (i.e., what kinds of names will the Python interpreter
        allow?)</b></p>
<p>Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore</p>
<p>The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores.</p>
<p>Names are case sensitive.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What are the numerical types available in Python that we’ve used so far? How do they differ?
    </b></p>
<p><b>Integer</b> Positive or negative whole numbers without decimal points</p>
<p><b>Float</b> Positive or negative numbers of arbitrary precision represented by values to the right of a decimal
    (floating) point</p>
<p><b>Complex</b> Numbers with two float values representing a real and imaginary component</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What are the sequential data types we’ve looked at so far? What are some similarities between them?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>String</b> Immutable (cannot be changed)</li>
    <li><b>Tuple</b> Immutable (cannot be changed)</li>
    <li><b>Bytes</b> Immutable (cannot be changed)</li>
    <li><b>List</b> Mutable (can be changed)</li>
    <li><b>Bytearray</b> Mutable (can be changed)</li>
    <li><b>zip()</b> List can only be iterate once.</li>
    <li><b>range()</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>• What is mutability? What does it mean for a type to be immutable? Which types have we seen in Python
    are immutable? Which types are mutable? Does mutability affect assignment of values to variables? </p>
<p><b>A new valuable can be assigned (but cannot be changed.).</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is casting? How is it done in Python? Why/when is it necessary?</b></p>
<p>Casting in python is done using constructor functions:</p>
<p><b>int() float() str()</b></p>
<p>There may be times when you want to specify (change) a type on to a variable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What are some commonly used string methods and functions? How can you find the length of a string?
        How can you break a string into a list of substrings based on some separater (such as a space?)</b></p>
<p>.islower() .upper() .rstrip()</p>
<p>len(string)</p>
<p>.split() (default)</p>
<br>
<h2>Arithmetic and math</h2>
<p><b>• What do the following operators do: +, -, +=, /, //, %, *, **?
    </b></p>
<p>+: add to</p>
<p>-: take away</p>
<p>+=: increments x by y</p>
<p>/: divided by</p>
<p>//: floor of x divided by y</p>
<p>%: remainder of x divided by y</p>
<p>*: times</p>
<p>**: x raised to y power</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What does the increment operator look like, and how does it behave?
    </b></p>
<p>+=: increments x by y</p>
<p><b>• What are two ways of finding a square root of a number?
    </b></p>
<p>1. math.sqrt()</p>
<p>2. ** 0.5</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What needs to be done in order to use functions from the math library module</b></p>
<p>import math</p>
<p><b>question: shall import math as m?</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>“Overloading” operators means having operators carry out different functionality in different contexts.
        The + and * operators are both overloaded in that they have different behaviors depending on the types
        of their operands. What are some examples of overloading of those operators?
    </b></p>
<p><b>+:</b></p>
<p># add numbers</p>
<p>print(1+2)</p>
<p># concatenate two strings</p>
<p>print("Geeks"+"For")</p>
<br>
<p><b>*:</b></p>
<p># Product two numbers</p>
<p>print(3 * 4)</p>
<p># Repeat the String </p>
<p>print("Geeks"*4)</p>
<br>
<h2>Booleans and conditionals
</h2>
<p><b>• What are the possible values of a Boolean type?</b></p>
<p>True and False</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>• What key word is used to assess whether a statement is true?
    </b></p>
<p>If</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is the difference between == and is?</b></p>
<p>The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects,</p>
<p>whereas the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory. </p>
<br>
<p><b>• What do <=, <,>=, and > do?</b></p>
<p>Comparison</p>
<br>
<p><b>• How are the not, and, and or operators related to Boolean values? What are these operators used for?</b></p>
<p>More complex boolean expressions can be built out of simpler expressions, using boolean operators</p>
<p><b>not:</b> Changes true to false, and false to true</p>
<p><b>and:</b> True if and only if both sides are true</p>
<p><b>or:</b> True if either side is true (or if both are true)</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is the structure and meaning of an if/elif/else statement? Which parts of that structure are
        required, which are optional, and what rules govern their ordering? (For example, can the structure begin
        with elif? Can an elif block precede an else block?)
    </b></p>
<p>if(): elif(): else:</p>
<p>decision making (conditional execution)</p>
<p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome.</p>
<p>if statement is required; else and elif statements are optional</p>
<p>if comes first, else comes at the ned, with at most only one else</p>
<p>the structure cannot begin
    with elif. An elif block cannot precede an else block</p>
<br>
<h2>Loops</h2>
<p><b>• In what respect are while loops and if statements similar?
    </b></p>
<p>the if is a one time branching operation and the while loop is as the name implies a loop.</p>
<p>Meaning an if statement gives you once the possibility to do something or not (or something else).</p>
<p>Whereas a while loop does things as long as the condition is true.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is necessary in order to use a for loop?</b></p>
<p>The loop should be definite</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is a simple way to implement a for loop that repeats some action a fixed number of times?
    </b></p>
<p>for _ in range()</p>
<br>
<p><b>• If a for loop begins for n in “hello”: how many times will the code in the following block
        execute? What will the value be of n each time the block executes?</b></p>
<p>5: "h","e","l","l","o"</p>
<br>
<p><b>• If a for loop begins for n in zip(range(3), “hello”): how many times will the code in
        the following block execute? What will the value be of n each time the block executes?
    </b></p>
<p>(0, 'h'),
    (1, 'e'),
    (2, 'l')</p>
<br>
<p><b>• Can a for loop contain another for loop? Are there any limits on what sorts of loops and conditionals
        can be nested in each other?
    </b></p>
<p>yes. (question: Not really limits???)</p>
<br>
<h2>Lists, tuples, and iterable objects</h2>
<p><b>• What types of objects can be elements of lists? What restrictions are there, if any, on what types of
        values can populate the same list together?
    </b></p>
<p>No limits</p>
<br>
<p><b>• How can a specific element of a list be accessed?</b></p>
<p>We may access the elements contained in a list via their position (index) within the list.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• Lists and tuples are both ordered sequential data types. What is the most important difference between
        lists and tuples?
    </b></p>
<p>list: mutable; tuple: immutable</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What style of loop is a list comprehension closely related to?</b></p>
<p>for loop</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What does the zip() function take as arguments? What does it return? (Careful, it doesn’t return a
        list!)
    </b></p>
<p>The zip() function takes iterables (can be zero or more), aggregates them in a <b>tuple</b>, and return it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>What do lists have in common with iterable objects such as range() and zip()?</b></p>
<p>List can be iterable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What construction this an example of? [ord(c) for c in "Python"]</b></p>
<p>returns integers in every character in string python, which represent the ascii numerical of c.</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What type of object does the code in the previous bullet point generate?
    </b></p>
<p>List</p>
<br>
<p><b>Given the following 2d list (list of lists) </b></p>
<p><b>my_2d_list = [[‘a’,’b’,’c’], [‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’], [‘g’, ‘h’, ‘i’]] </b></p>
<p><b>• how specifically would you access the character ‘e’ in this data structure?
    </b></p>
<p>my_2d_list[1][1]</p>
<br>
<p><b>• How might you split a string representing a sentence into a list of strings representing words? (A naive
        approach is fine here). </b></p>
<p>.split()</p>
<br>
<h2>Libraries and modules</h2>
<p><b>• What functionality from the sys and math libraries have we seen so far?</b></p>
<p>sys.argv() sys.exit()</p>
<p>math.pow(x,y) math.cos(x) math.sin(x) math.radians(x) math.sqrt(x) math.pi(CONSTANT)</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is the syntax for bringing the functionality of a library into your script?</b></p>
<p>from math import sqrt as sq</p>
<p>from math import *</p>
<p>import math</p>
<p>import turtle as t</p>
<p>t.penup()</p>
<br>
<h2>General Python knowledge</h2>
<p><b>• Python is whitespace sensitive. What does this mean, and what is an example of this?
    </b></p>
<p>Python uses whitespace syntactically. Code blocks are delineated by indentation.</p>
<p>for _ in range(2):</p>
<p> print("Hello")</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is a “block” of code in Python. What character indicates the start of a new block, and how is the
        code of a block identified as such?</b></p>
<p>A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. Python uses indetation</p>
<p>All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. </p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is the programming “paradigm” used by Python? Is there just one?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A programming paradigm is an approach to solve the problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a
    method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.</p>
<p>there are three types:</p>
<p>Object Oriented programming paradigms</p>
<p>Procedure Oriented programming paradigms</p>
<p>Functional programming paradigms</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What style of capitalization is typically used in Python? What is it called?</b></p>
<p>1. for comments: it should capitalize the first letter</p>
<br>
<p><b>• What is a REPL?
    </b></p>
<p>REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. The REPL is how you interact with the Python Interpreter.</p>
<p>in the REPL you can type commands and instantly see the output printed out.</p>
